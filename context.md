I’ve had it! It’s enough. I can’t stand this anymore and now I know what I should do about it.

I’m trapped in a cycle of unplanned devotions. 
I’m surrounded with distractions and cannot focus.
I’m addicted to the process of consuming.
&
I cannot put in time to be productive to achieve my goals and if this compounds over time, it’ll end in my demise. So, no more can I waste my time, no more can I feed my attention to the ever enhancing technology made on human psychology.

So as a resistance measure, I'm planning to create a software that will help assist me in my daily life.
Help me in building my routine
Measure Commitments & Deadline (Time Management)
Handles miscommitment scenarios with time flexibility
Applies habit building lessons from books such as Atomic Habits
AI coach that will help in refining habits every week

This will be done with the help of AI to remove the negative sides of AI and newer technologies that are grabbing us in this attention economy and gather us to what we really want to be. A method of self manipulation if you will, where we plan ourselves with measures to achieve our truly wanted selves; rather than AI working for us, it’ll be building us. So you can say an AI coach as opposed to an AI assistant.

In the first phase of the project, I will dedicate 100 days to building the app in minor iterations. Here are the rules for the project:
100 days of consistent work, dedicating 1 hour a day to development at least.
Daily progress update on LinkedIn
The technology stack will be
NextJS
Firebase
Flutter
Node
The project will be completely opensource, so anyone can contribute to the mission.

The goal is to create a system that controls our behaviors and forces good habits.
It will analyze the habits and find flaws in the regress.
Users will update the strategy after every interval to further force good habits.
Find solutions with the Help of an AI Coach.
A lot of other tools that help us with different aspects of life.

If you have any ideas to share please let me know. We will enhance the project along the way. As the project is free & opensource, it’s meant for everyone to contribute & use. I will update tomorrow on the progress!
